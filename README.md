# Canonical scalar field perturbations in Bianchi I spacetime using Mathematica

In this work, the linear perturbations of the Einstein field and motion
equations are derived in a Bianchi I background metric for the case of
the canonical scalar field. The calculation is performed based on the
instructions provided by the xPand, xPert, and xTensor packages of
Wolfram Mathematica. A brief review of geometric concepts associated
with hypersurfaces of the embedding space in a 4-dimensional Lorentzian
manifold with signature (âˆ’, +, +, +) is presented, along with their
connection to the basic theory behind cosmological perturbations in an
anisotropic Bianchi type I spacetime. The relationship between the
previous concepts and the instructions provided by the software is then
established, from which a code implementation is created to find the
perturbation equations, detailing the most important aspects of the
algorithm used. Finally, some observations on the results obtained, the
algorithm, and the methodology applied are presented, along with an
appendix containing all the code used during this project.
